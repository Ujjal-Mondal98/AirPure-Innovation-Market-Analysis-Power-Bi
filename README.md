## 💡 Key Insights for AirPure Innovations

### 1. 🎯 Pollutant Targeting Strategy
- **PM2.5 & PM10 Filters** – Mandatory across all regions due to fine particulate pollution.  
- **CO Filters** – Recommended for **Karnataka** (Bengaluru) due to high traffic emissions.  
- **O₃ (Ozone) Filters** – Required for **Delhi & Gurugram**, which face high photochemical smog.  
- **Industrial Filters** – For **Byrnihat (Assam)** to target **VOCs, SO₂, NO₂**, and dust.  
- **Allergen Filters** – (Pollen, pet dander, mold) recommended for all regions, especially semi-rural zones.  
- **Seasonal Adjustability** – Switchable filter modes based on peak pollution seasons.

### 2. ⚙️ Essential Product Features
- **Smart Features** – WiFi, mobile app control, responsive touch panel.  
- **Real-Time AQI Sensors** – Monitor PM2.5/PM10 and auto-adjust fan speed.  
- **Low-Noise Operation** – Ideal for night use in bedrooms.  
- **Child-Safe Design** – Secure panels, no sharp edges.  
- **Strong After-Sales Support** – Easy filter replacement & reliable service.  
- **Affordable Pricing** – Especially for Tier-2 cities, without compromising quality.  
- **Energy Efficiency** – Optimized power usage for continuous operation.  
- **Compact Form Factor** – Suitable for urban apartments with limited space.

### 3. 📍 High-Demand Regions Identified
#### **Tier 1 Cities**
- Delhi NCR  
- Bengaluru (Karnataka)  
- Bahadurgarh (Haryana)  

#### **Tier 2 Cities**
- Patna & Hajipur (Bihar)  
- Lucknow (Uttar Pradesh)  
- Byrnihat (Assam)  

**Trend Insight:** Market demand has surged post-COVID due to rising **health awareness**, **urbanization**, and **increasing pollution levels**.

---

### 4. 🧪 R&D Alignment with Local Pollution
- **Regional Customization** – Filter types tailored for specific pollutants in each state.  
- **Modular Filter System** – Especially for industrial zones (SO₂, VOCs, dust).  
- **Allergen & Dust Priority** – For semi-rural and high pollen regions.  
- **Affordable & Low-Noise Designs** – For residential markets.  
- **Durability Testing** – Filters tested under high-humidity and dust-heavy conditions.  
- **Smart AQI Sync** – Device automatically adjusts settings based on live AQI feed.

---

### 5. 📊 Additional Market & Data Insights
- **Irreversible AQI Decline** observed in Tier 1 & 2 cities, especially during winter months.  
- **Health Impact Correlation** – AQI spikes are linked with **pediatric asthma admissions** in polluted cities.  
- **Seasonal Demand Peaks** – Highest search and purchase interest during **post-Diwali smog** and **harvest burning seasons**.  
- **Competitor Gap Analysis** – Existing products lack **regional filter customization** and **compact designs for smaller homes**.  
- **Vehicle Density Link** – Areas with high registered vehicle counts (VAHAN data) show proportionally higher AQI readings.

---

## 📊 Data Sources
- **AQI Data** – Daily monitoring data across Indian cities (PM2.5, PM10, O₃, CO, SO₂, NO₂ levels).  
- **IDSP** – Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (respiratory illness trends).  
- **VAHAN** – Vehicle registration data by state and city.  
- **Population Projections** – For market sizing and demand estimation.  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI** – Data modeling, DAX measures, interactive dashboard creation.  
- **Excel** – Data cleaning and preprocessing.  
- **CapCut** – Video Presentation.  

---

## 🖼️ Prototype Design
A modern **smart air purifier** designed with:
- **Real-time AQI display**  
- **Compact, minimalist body**  
- **360° air intake** for efficiency  
- **Mobile app integration** (planned feature)
